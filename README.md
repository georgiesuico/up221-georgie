# Profile
Hi everyone! My name is Georgie Suico, a first year MURP with concentrating in TPP. I'm originally from Cebu, Philippines, and spent the first few months in the U.S. living in New London, Wisconsin. I spent most of my childhood in Boyle Heights and then moved to the San Fernando Valley as a teenager. 
# course description
From my understanding, 221 is intended to cultivate skills in working with data/data science to produce spatially aware visualizations of information. 
# project ideas
One area of study I've been interested in lately is the impact of jeepney modernization (e.g., fleet electrification) programs in the Philippines, such as how they affect low-income ridership and operational costs. Although this data likely does not (yet!) exist, I would be interested in mapping which areas are pursuing modernization more aggressively, as well as the potentially changing ridership demographics. 
Otherwise, I'm also interested in exploring topics like electric mobility, climate resilient planning (especially in urban + coastal areas), and more sustainable goods movement (such as microdelivery!). 
# course objectives
I've worked on GIS projects before but lacked the technical skills to do much outside of the basics, so I'm very excited to dive deeper into the subject. GIS can be used in so many different disciplines and can visibilize/communicate unseen data, so I hope to be able to use the content in this course to create meaningful and engaging maps. As someone who has never learned how to code, I also look forward to developing coding skills!
